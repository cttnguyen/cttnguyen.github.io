    - question :  "1. What COVID precautions will you be taking"
      answer : |
        To keep our vendors and loved ones safe, we respectfully request that all guests aged 5 and up be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to attending the wedding. Guests under age 5 are still welcome.
        
        Masks are welcome but not required, and hand sanitizer will be available throughout the venue.
        
        We will require proof of a negative COVID test result prior to the ceremony.
        
        We will provide rapid at-home tests to be taken at the hotel (or nearby homes if you're in the area!).
        
        If we are unable to coordinate delivery of a rapid test to you, we ask that you arrive at 3:15 PM to ensure ample time to take a test at our COVID testing station on site prior to the ceremony.
        
        Otherwise, if you are not feeling well the morning of the wedding, we ask that you exercise caution and stay home. 
        
        Should your travel plans change due to COVID or not, please let us know and we will adapt! We hate to miss you, but we understand that the pandemic circumstances are difficult for all.
        
        As the pandemic situation is constantly changing, these precautions are subject to change to be more or less stringent. Please check back as we get closer to the date for the most up to date information.
        
    - question : "2. What happened to the Vietnamese Tea Ceremony?"
      answer : |
        We would have loved for you all to be there, but unfortunately we are no longer able to invite all guests to this event as we had initially intended.
        
        For this reason, we are now planning the tea ceremony separately from the main wedding event, and we will have a reduced guest list.
        
        We hope that you can understand the difficult choices we've had to make in light of the pandemic, and we apologize for any confusion or inconvience this may have made.

    - question :  "3. What is the recommended attire?"
      answer : |
        We recommend semi-formal: your favorite suit, cocktail dress, or jumpsuit.
      
        However, we hope that you will feel free to come as you are, whether thatâ€™s in a t-shirt and jeans or your prom dress!

    - question :  "4. Is any part of the celebration outdoors?"
      answer : |
        Yes, the wedding ceremony and cocktail hour will be held outdoors. This is subject to change in the case of inclement weather.
        
        Depending on the pandemic, we may move the reception to be outdoors as well.
      
    - question :  "5. Where can I find parking?"
      answer : |
        The hotel and venue both have ample parking available for free.
        
        The parking area at the venue is not paved, but a courtesy golf cart shuttle will be available to transport guests from the parking area to the venue entrance.

    - question :  "6. Will transportation be provided?"
      answer : |
        Yes, there will be a coach bus to transport guests between the venue and hotel.
        
        The schedule is still to be determined. Tentatively, the shuttle will depart the hotel at 3:30 PM. Then, beginning at 8:00 PM, it will make trips back to the hotel as needed with a final trip at 10:00 PM.
        
    - question :  "7. How should I submit my RSVP?"
      answer : |
        If you have already RSVP'd, no need to worry about letting us know twice. We'll just take your most recent response toward our headcount.
      
        You can RSVP by mailing back the RSVP card found in your invitation or by filling out our form online here:

    - question :  "8. Who is Bishop?"
      answer : |
        Since you've made it this far, you must know the password to this site, and you might be wondering who Bishop is. Bishop is the cutest cat in Boston (and maybe the world). Here he is lying on one of his cat beds, also known as \"Crystal\'s Sweaters.\"
