    - question : "1. Can you tell me more about the Vietnamese tea ceremony?"
      answer : |
        The tea ceremony is the traditional wedding ritual performed in Vietnamese culture. The bride and groom pour tea for their parents and grandparents while receiving blessings or marital advice in return. Please note that it may be difficult to hear some of the more intimate parts of the ceremony which are performed without a microphone.
  
        The main difference for guests is the procession. The family of the bride gathers inside the sanctuary upon arrival. Barring any inclement weather, family of the groom and any friends are asked to assemble outside and follow the procession inside when the ceremony begins.

        We know that attending a Friday event may be difficult for many, but we hope you’ll join us if you are able to make it!

    - question :  "2. What is the recommended attire?"
      answer : |
        For the wedding on Saturday, we recommend semi-formal: your favorite suit, dress, or pantsuit.

        For the tea ceremony on Friday, we recommend “dressy casual” (see here). We also welcome ao dai, a traditional Vietnamese style of clothing, or any traditional attire from your culture.

        However, we hope that you will feel free to come as you are, whether that’s in a t-shirt and jeans or your prom dress!

    - question :  "7. Who is Bishop?"
      answer : |
        Since you've made it this far, you must know the password to this site, and you might be wondering who Bishop is. Bishop is the cutest cat in Boston (and maybe the world). Here he is lying on one of his cat beds, also known as \"Crystal\'s Sweaters.\"
