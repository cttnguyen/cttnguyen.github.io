**1. What is a Vietnamese tea ceremony?**

<div class="nobullet">
* This is a great question! I don't really know either, but I'll have Crystal fill in this section when she gets a chance.
</div>


**2. What is the recommended attire?**

<div class="nobullet">
* Daniel will be wearing a suit. Crystal will be wearing a floor-length dress. We are recommending "dressy casual" to the Tea Ceremony and semi-formal to the wedding on Saturday. To us, dressy casual means anything that isn't jeans, and semiformal means ties without tuxes and dresses that don't have to be floor length. However, we hope that you will feel free to come as you are!
</div>

**3. Are my kids invited?**

<div class="nobullet">
* If their name is on the inner envelope of the invitation, they are most certainly welcome!
</div>

**4. Who is Bishop?**

<div class="nobullet">
* Since you've made it this far you must know the password to this site, so you might be wondering who Bishop is. Bishop is the cutest cat in Boston (and maybe the world). Here he is lying on his cat bed, also known as, "Crystal's sweaters."
