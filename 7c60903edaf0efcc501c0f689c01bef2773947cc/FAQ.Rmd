**1. What is a Vietnamese tea ceremony?**

<div class="nobullet">
* The tea ceremony is the traditional wedding ritual performed in Vietnamese culture. 
Starting outside, male relatives of the groom process bearing 
gifts of cookies, tea, wine, 
and fruit, followed by the groom and his family, and friends of the bride 
and groom. The processional is welcomed at the threshold by female relatives of the bride 
who accept the gifts and place them at the altar. The ceremony proceeds with 
introductions of the families and statements of consent from the parents. 
The bride is then escorted down the aisle by her mother. 
The bride and groom pour tea for their parents and 
grandparents while receiving blessings or marital advice. Note that this portion of 
the ceremony is meant to be quite intimate, and guests are usually unable to hear what is 
spoken by the parents and grandparents. The ceremony concludes by pouring tea and burning 
incense in honor of deceased relatives of the bride and groom.

**2. What should we do when we arrive at the tea ceremony?**

<div class="nobullet">
* Feel free to gather 
outside the church to join in the traditional processional, led by the grooms's male 
relatives carrying gifts, followed by the groom, the rest of the groom's family, 
and finally, friends of the bride and groom. 
</div>


**2. What is the recommended attire?**

<div class="nobullet">
* For the wedding on Saturday, we recommend semi-formal: suits but not 
tuxes, and dresses that need not be floor length. 

* For the tea ceremony on Friday, we recommend "dressy casual": anything a step up from jeans. Also acceptable are ao dai, a traditional Vietnamese style of clothing.

* However, we hope that you will feel free to come as you are, whether that's jeans or your prom dress!
</div>

**3. Is any part of the celebration outdoors?**
<div class="nobullet">
* Yes, the wedding ceremony and cocktail hour will be held outdoors, barring any inclement weather.
</div>

**4. Who is Bishop?**

<div class="nobullet">
* Since you've made it this far, you must know the password to this site, and you might be wondering who Bishop is. Bishop is the cutest cat in Boston (and maybe the world). Here he is lying on his cat bed, also known as "Crystal's sweaters."

**5. Will Bishop be at the wedding?**
<div class="nobullet">

</div>

* This is still TBD, but we are hoping to find transportation to and from the hotel on both evenings for wedding guests!
</div>

<div class="nobullet">
