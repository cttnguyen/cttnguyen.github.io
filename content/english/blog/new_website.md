I thought the gap between my last two posts was a long time, but it's been almost a year since I last posted! I guess if you just don't count the pandemic, then basically no time has passed.

I'm back now! If it wasn't clear, we've been on quite the planning hiatus over this last, rocky year. More on wedding planning during a pandemic in another post, but, first, look at our fancy new website design!
  
Since I started work, my roles and duties have changed quite a bit. I've transitioned to a more data visualization-focused role, where I spend __a lot__ of time programming dashboards with interactive graphics. Because of that, I've picked up a little more experience with html programming and the knowledge that `blogdown`, a sibling of `RMarkdown` but better suited for fancy looking blog sites, exists. Pair these with the boredom from a pandemic, and you've got yourself a version 2.0 of a website!

I'll admit it was sometimes painful. I used the {{< tablink "Hugo framework" "https://gohugo.io/" >}} and an existing theme, {{< tablink "Meghna-Hugo" "https://themes.gohugo.io/meghna-hugo/" >}} to start. If you've ever done any programming, though, then you know that editing someone else's code is __the worst__. It was decently organized, not as well documented as most things in R (though to be fair, none of the website design takes place in R anymore), and minimally commented. Luckily, you can right click + inspect (or `ctrl+shift+i`) a webpage and pull up the exact code that pertains to an object you select on the page. This was immensely helpful when figuring out website element was what in the code.

I'll not bore you with anymore technical details; I mostly just had to rearrange the code to suit our needs and swap out all the hex codes for our custom colors. Before moving on though, I did want to draw attention to my favorite new feature of the website. If you look at the tab at the top of your browser (at least if you're using Google Chrome), you'll notice that our website has a little tab logo. It might be a little too small to make out very clearly, but you've probably guessed it. It's Bishop.

Apparently cutting out a rough shape from a photo isn't too difficult in Inkscape. Once it's the size of your pinky nail, you can no longer make out the rough edges anyways. I tried to make some other logo with our initials, but I decided if Bishop couldn't make it on our wedding day, he could at least be the face of our website.
