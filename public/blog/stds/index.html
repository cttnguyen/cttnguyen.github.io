          <p>It&rsquo;s been a minute since I last posted! That&rsquo;s mostly because things have slowed down, as you may have noticed, due to this little COVID-19 bug that&rsquo;s been going around. I hope you&rsquo;re all staying safe and sound. Daniel and I have had a few conversations on what we think the plan is come time for our wedding, but the truth is we just can&rsquo;t make any decisions until closer to then. Things are changing so fast that it&rsquo;s hard for us to predict what the world is going to look like in even just a few months. Even if Texas relaxes restrictions on gathering sizes, it still might not be safe enough to have all our loved ones put themselves at risk for travel. We will definitely keep you all updated as we make our decisions, though!</p>
<p>On a lighter note, we sent out our save the dates this afternoon! I really enjoyed this project, especially since we got to really make it our own, and it saved us a pretty penny, too! There are actually two parts to this one: designing the save the dates and making the envelopes. That&rsquo;s right, we <em><strong>made</strong></em> the envelopes. Seems silly, I know, but I wasn&rsquo;t really into spending $30 on envelopes after we&rsquo;d saved at least that much by printing our own save the dates.</p>
<p>So first, designing these things. It&rsquo;s actually not that hard! Some free software, a good quality photo, and a glass of wine (optional) are all you need. I used <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
  <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">
    Inkscape
  </a>
</span>, a free and open source vector graphics editor. It will do similar things to Adobe Photoshop or InDesign, and, for the budget-bride, it&rsquo;s just the right price. The user interface for this software is&hellip;not ideal, but again it is <em><strong>free</strong></em>.</p>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll want to go to <code>File &gt; Document Properties</code> and set the size of your save the date. We were going to print using the postcard size at Staples, so I went ahead and used those dimensions. Next, import your image (<code>File &gt; Import</code>), and crop it to your desired size by <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
  <a href="https://www.selfmadedesigner.com/cropping-inkscape/" target="_blank">
    clipping it
  </a>
</span>. We used the original file from our engagement photographer to keep the super high resolution.</p>
<p>Easily add words using the text box feature. Luckily, unlike the Cricut Design Space software, you do not have to manually place letters. Similar to Microsoft Word, you can set the character and line spacing to your preferences.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/blog/std_inkscape_test3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Honestly, the back was more difficult because of the flowers. I found an image using these flowers as a free scalable vector graphic (svg) file just by a simple google search. You want to find a .svg as opposed to another image filetype to better maintain the quality of the image when you go to print. That way, you&rsquo;ll limit the risk of getting something that looks really rough and pixelated. Again, I fiddled around with it, cropping, duplicating, rotating, and more to rearrange the original flower file into the repeated pattern with the middle section cut out. It took longer than I&rsquo;d like to admit, but the back of the card <em><strong>needed</strong></em> color.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/blog/std_back2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>They came together really well, and with a coupon from Staples, we only spent $60 to print 250 of them at the postcard size. We did not need 250, but this was the smallest amount we could buy to get the number we actually needed (125). Compare this to using a premade template and just filling in our information for $175 at Vistaprint at the time we got them printed (December 2019) for 150. And we wouldn&rsquo;t get to use our own fonts, either!</p>
<p>Okay, now for the envelopes, because you know every extra penny is getting pinched to put toward that sweet, sweet open bar.</p>

</ul>

</div>
<p>I found a free template for envelopes posted by some very kind soul <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
  <a href="https://www.simplycraftysvgs.com/shop/freebies/basic-envelope-set/" target="_blank">

  </a>
</span> . Most people would post it for sale on Etsy or Cricut, but lucky for me I found these. The trick to get custom sized envelopes is to calculate the scale factor to get the perforation area to fit your card size. The box marking the perforation area is where your card will actually fit into, so you&rsquo;ll also want to leave a bit of extra room. That extra space will leave wiggle room for the card to slide in and for the paper to fold on itself. For example, if the width of the perforate rectangle in the template is 8&quot; and your card is 4&quot; wide, you&rsquo;ll want to resize that box to be 4 1/8&quot; wide. So <code>4.125 / 8 = 0.52</code>. Then multiply the width of the entire cut + score object by <code>0.52</code> and resize to that value. Do the same with the length.</p>
<p>Next is addressing the envelopes. Recall from my last post that this is tedious to set up in Cricut Design Space: you have to manually place all of the cursive letters in the Cricut Design Space software to make it look like one fluid written stroke. Another difficulty I encountered was the overall placement of the design onto the envelope. Cricut leaves a 1/4&quot; left margin on all projects to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t go off the page. This is not so ideal for this envelope template that barely fits on 8.5 x 11&quot; cardstock. I had to offset the cardstock on the mat by 1/4&quot; to make sure it fit. I had to toss a few in the recycling because it was too far in either direction.</p>
<p>As much as I love the drawing feature of the Cricut Explore Air 2, I wasn&rsquo;t about spending $4 per pen for the Cricut brand pen. Cricut smartly creates their own pens, and you basically have to be lucky to find a pen of the same thickness to fit into the machine if you want to go off brand. However, I found a pen Daniel&rsquo;s parents had given us for Christmas a couple years ago. It&rsquo;s got a great felt tip for a craft like this, <em><strong>and it was free</strong></em> (to us). Unfortunately, it was too skinny to fit into my Cricut. Since I didn&rsquo;t want to be reliant on whatever pens Cricut decides to produce, I purchased a set of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
  <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/485896064/ultimate-cricut-exploremaker-pen-adapter?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=cricut&#43;pen&#43;adapter&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-1&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;frs=1&amp;bes=1&amp;col=1" target="_blank">
    adapters
  </a>
</span> that would allow me to use whatever pen/marker of my choosing in the Cricut! One of these fit the new pen perfectly, so when my Cricut pen from the original bundle ran out of ink, I easily switched to this one. Actually, I liked it better as it was a bit thinner and gave more of an actually handwritten look.</p>
<p>Finally, all that was left was to assemble! Fold along the perforated lines, and tape the flaps down. I had the best results when applying the tape to the flaps on the top and bottom rather than the left and right sides. My mom had gotten me the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/3M-700-Adhesive-Applicator-Dispenses/dp/B007VTQC64/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=scotch&#43;atg&#43;700&amp;qid=1588458126&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">
    Scotch ATG 700 double-sided tape gun
  </a>
</span> for Christmas this last year. Naturally, I was elated. This is one of my favorite new crafting tools. We&rsquo;ve taped up all the save the dates, and we haven&rsquo;t even gone through half of the first wheel of tape. The tape holds SO WELL; it is better than any other adhesive I&rsquo;ve ever used. It goes on clean and smooth. The two caveats are price and it being a bit difficult to replace the tape wheel inside the dispenser.</p>
<p>I think that about sums it up. Happy crafting, and stay safe out there!</p>
